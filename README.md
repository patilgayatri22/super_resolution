# Super Resolution (Image Enhancement Project)

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and experiments for **Image Super-Resolution** — the task of enhancing the quality and resolution of low-resolution images using deep learning models. In this project, we explore neural network based approaches to generate high-resolution outputs from low-resolution inputs.

Image Super-Resolution is widely used in Photo enhancement

The goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images that are sharper and more visually detailed than traditional interpolation methods (e.g., bicubic) can provide.

## Models

### AGDN
**AGDN (Adaptive Gradient Deep Network)** is a deep learning architecture tailored for super-resolution tasks. It focuses on learning fine details from LR (low-resolution) images to reconstruct sharper HR (high-resolution) outputs.

### VGEP
**VGEP (Vision-Guided Enhancement Pipeline)** aims to further improve reconstructed quality by using a multi-stage enhancement method — combining learned features with perceptual guidance.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patilgayatri22/super_resolution.git
cd super_resolution

```

## Evaluation Metrics

Common metrics used for super-resolution quality evaluation:
PSNR	(Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
